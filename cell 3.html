    <p><h2>Golgi Apparatus</h2>h2>
<br>The Golgi apparatus, or Golgi complex, functions as a factory in which proteins received from the ER are further processed and sorted for transport to their eventual destinations: lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or secretion.<br> <br>In addition, as noted earlier, glycolipids and sphingomyelin are synthesized within the Golgi<br>. <br>In plant cells, the Golgi apparatus further serves as the site at which the complex polysaccharides of the cell wall are synthesized<br>. <br>The Golgi apparatus is thus involved in processing the broad range of cellular constituents that travel along the secretory pathway<br>.


<br>Organization of the Golgi
Morphologically the Golgi is composed of flattened membrane-enclosed sacs (cisternae) and associated vesicles<br> .<br>A striking feature of the Golgi apparatus is its distinct polarity in both structure and function.<br> <br>Proteins from the ER enter at its cis face (entry face), which is convex and usually oriented toward the nucleus<br>. <br>They are then transported through the Golgi and exit from its concave trans face (exit face)<br>. <br>As they pass through the Golgi, proteins are modified and sorted for transport to their eventual destinations within the cell<br> Electron micrograph of a Golgi apparatus.

<br>Distinct processing and sorting events appear to take place in an ordered sequence within different regions of the Golgi complex, so the Golgi is usually considered to consist of multiple discrete compartments<br>. <br>Although the number of such compartments has not been established, the Golgi is most commonly viewed as consisting of four functionally distinct regions<br>: the cisGolgi network, the Golgi stack (which is divided into the medial and trans subcompartments), and the transGolgi network (Figure 9.23). Proteins from the ER are transported to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and then enter the Golgi apparatus at the cis Golgi network. They then progress to the medial and trans compartments of the Golgi stack, within which most metabolic activities of the Golgi apparatus take place. The modified proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides then move to the trans Golgi network, which acts as a sorting and distribution center, directing molecular traffic to lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or the cell exterFigure 9.23
<h2>Regions of the Golgi apparatus</h2>. 
<br>Vesicles from the ER fuse to form the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and proteins from the ER are then transported to the cis Golgi network<br>. <br>Resident ER proteins are returned from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (more...<br>)

<br>Although the Golgi apparatus was first described over 100 years ago, the mechanism by which proteins move through the Golgi apparatus has still not been established and is an area of controversy among cell biologists<br>. <br>One possibility is that transport vesicles carry proteins between the cisternae of the Golgi compartments<br>. <br>However, there is considerable experimental support for an alternative model proposing that proteins are simply carried through compartments of the Golgi within the Golgi cisternae, which gradually mature and progressively move through the Golgi in the cis to trans direction.

<h2>Protein Glycosylation within the Golgi</h2>
<br>Protein processing within the Golgi involves the modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins<br>. <br>One of the major aspects of this processing is the modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides that were added to proteins in the ER<br>.<br> As discussed earlier in this chapter, proteins are modified within the ER by the addition of an oligosaccharide consisting of 14 sugar residues<br>. <br>Three glucose residues and one mannose are then removed while the polypeptides are still in the ER<br>. <br>Following transport to the Golgi apparatus, the N-linked oligosaccharides of these glycoproteins are subject to extensive further modifications.
