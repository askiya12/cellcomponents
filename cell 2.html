    <p><br><h2>Types of Cells</h2>
<br>Cells are similar to factories with different labourers and departments that work towards a common objective.<br> <br>Various types of cells perform different functions.<br> <br>Based on cellular structure, there are two types of cells:<br>

<h3>Prokaryotes</h3>
<h3>Eukaryotes</h3>

Explore: Difference Between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells

<h3>Prokaryotic Cells<h3>
<br>Main article: Prokaryotic Cells<br>

<br>Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus<br>. <br>Instead, some prokaryotes such as bacteria have a region within the cell where the genetic material is freely suspended<br>. This region is called the nucleoid.
<br>They all are single-celled microorganisms<br>. <br>Examples include archaea, bacteria, and cyanobacteria.<br>
<br>The cell size ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 µm in diameter.<br>
<br>The hereditary material can either be DNA or RNA.<br>
<br>Prokaryotes generally reproduce by binary fission, a form of asexual reproduction. They are also known to use conjugation – which is often seen as the prokaryotic equivalent to sexual reproduction (however, it is NOT sexual reproduction)<br>.
<h3>Eukaryotic Cells</h3>
<br>Main article: Eukaryotic Cells

Eukaryotic cells are characterised by a true nucleus.<br>
<br>The size of the cells ranges between 10–100 µm in diameter.
This broad category involves plants, fungi, protozoans,.
There are some contrasting features between plant and animal cells. For eg., the plant cell contains chloroplast, central vacuoles, and other plastids, whereas the animal cells do not.
Cell Structure<br>
The cell structure comprises individual components with specific functions essential to carry out life’s processes. These components include- cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, and cell organelles. Read on to explore more insights on cell structure and function.

<h3>Cell Membrane</h3>
<br>The cell membrane supports and protects the cell. It controls the movement of substances in and out of the cells. It separates the cell from the external environment. T.  Besides this, the cell membrane also protects the cellular component from damage and leakage.
It forms the wall-like structure between two cells as well as between the cell and its surroundings.<br>
<br>Plants are immobile, so their cell structures are well-adapted to protect them from external factors. The cell wall helps to reinforce this function.
Cell Wall<br>
<br>The cell wall is the most prominent part of the plant’s cell structure.<br>.<br> The cell wall is also the outermost layer of plant cells.
It is a rigid and stiff structure surrounding the cell membrane.<br>
<br>It provides shape and support to the cells and protects them from mechanical shocks and injuries.
Cytoplasm<br>
<br>The cytoplasm is a thick, clear, jelly-like substance present inside the cell membrane.
Most of the chemical reactions within a cell take place in this cytoplasm.
The cell organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles, mitochondria, ribosomes, are suspended in this cytoplasm.
Nucleus<br>
<br>The nucleus contains the hereditary material of the cell, the DNA.
The nucleus protects the DNA  and is an integral component of a plant’s cell structure.
Cell Organelles<br>
